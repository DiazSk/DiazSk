## 🎯 About Me

I'm a passionate **Data Engineer** focused on building scalable, reliable, and automated data platforms. With expertise in **distributed systems**, **real-time streaming**, and **cloud infrastructure**, I engineer robust solutions that turn raw data into actionable insights. I enjoy solving complex data challenges using modern technologies like Apache Spark, Flink, Kafka, and AWS.

### 💡 Core Competencies:
- **🏗️ Data Architecture**: Designing fault-tolerant ETL/ELT pipelines and data lakes/warehouses
- **⚡ Real-Time Processing**: Building low-latency streaming applications with Flink and Kafka
- **☁️ Cloud Engineering**: Architecting serverless and containerized solutions on AWS
- **🛠️ Data Ops**: Implementing CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), and Data Quality checks

### 🎯 Current Focus:
- 🔭 Advanced Stream Processing patterns with Apache Flink
- 🌱 Optimizing Data Lakehouse architectures
- 💻 Contributing to open-source data engineering projects
- 📚 Pursuing AWS Certified Solutions Architect certification
